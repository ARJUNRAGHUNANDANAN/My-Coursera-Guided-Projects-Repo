# Coursera Guided Projects Repository

This repository contains the files and resources from the **Coursera Guided Projects** that I have completed. 

## About Coursera Guided Projects

Guided Projects on Coursera, offered by **Coursera Project Network**, are interactive learning experiences that allow learners to gain job-relevant skills in under two hours. These projects provide a hands-on environment with a side-by-side interface, enabling learners to follow visual instructions while applying the learned skills in real time.

I am keeping my Coursera Guided Projects separate from Coursera Courses & Specializations, even though they are grouped together in the accomplishments page. This repository aims to showcase my learning journey through these practical, skill-based projects.
